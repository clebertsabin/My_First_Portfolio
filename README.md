# My_First_Portfolio

## Description
This project is my first step into web development.  
It focuses on learning the basics of **HTML**, creating valid web pages, and structuring content using semantic tags.  
The goal is to understand how web pages are built, how browsers interpret them, and how to write clean, valid code.

- Explain what HTML is and how it works.
- Create valid HTML pages using markup.
- Understand the DOM (Document Object Model).
- Use elements, tags, and attributes properly.
